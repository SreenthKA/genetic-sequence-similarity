# Genetic Sequence Similarity Calculator

This Python code calculates the similarity between genetic sequences using the Jaro similarity measure and the Levenshtein (edit) distance. Genetic sequence similarity is essential for various bioinformatics and molecular biology applications.

## Features

- Calculate Jaro similarity scores for genetic sequences.
- Utilize the Levenshtein distance to measure sequence similarity.
- Generate similarity matrices for sets of genetic sequences.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/genetic-sequence-similarity.git
1. Install the required Python libraries.

```bash
pip install python-Levenshtein
